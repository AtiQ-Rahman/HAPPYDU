### Spreading Happiness
Say Yes to Happiness and No to Depression . Sadness is a normal emotion, and we all feel it at certain times of life. While there are many factors that lead sadness to depression, one of the most sinister is “reward erosion.” If you’ve been depressed, you almost certainly experienced the shoreline of your life shrinking, plunging your life into pits of depression like a house falling into the sea.
### About Happy DU
Happy DU is a nonprofit organization working for the mentally depressed students. It established in February 2018 after hearing back to back news of suicide of the beloved students of our university. From the urge of doing something for the depressed students Musabbir Hussain, a student of Zoology Department,University Of Dhaka(DU) with Md. Atiquer Rahman(Institute of Information Technology-IIT,DU),Ishrat Jahan Emu (IIT,DU) started Happy DU. Later former student of Banking and Finance Tahmina Akhter, Kaifa Ibrahim from Disaster Management, Shaila Islam from Accounting Information System, Sadia Afroz Shams from Psychology joined Happy DU.No one can proceed without struggling. We are also struggling from the beginning till now. It was not easy at first to understand someone about our operation. We started with few depressed people and got their positive feedback that helped us to thrive forward. We didn’t have professional psychotherapist when we started Happy DU. But we had to deal with those depressed students in spite of having all of these shortages. We dealt with students and still dealing who are determined to commit suicide. But at first it was not easy at all
### Moner Chithi
“Moner Chithi” is a google form where a person can share his/her problems or views anonymously. Then we post the problems in our group for discussion and solution. We also referred the critically depressed students immediately to the professional psychotherapist. Anyone can contact us through our official page of Happy DU. Then we provide the necessary steps needed for the students. We started giving scholarship among the students who are depressed for financial crisis but it stopped due to lack of funding.
